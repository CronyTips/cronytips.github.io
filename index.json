[{"content":"In this post I will explain my reason\u0026rsquo;s for using and loving linux. And they also serve as reasons as to why you should use linux.\n1. It\u0026rsquo;s free GNU/Linux is a free operating system. If I wan\u0026rsquo;t to install linux on my machine I don\u0026rsquo;t need to spend 100$ on a license just to do a installation or do a clean install. This is also one of the reasons that I distro hopped for about 2 years until I settled down on manjaro for about 1 year.\n2. It\u0026rsquo;s open-source GNU/Linux is open source which means that if you wan\u0026rsquo;t you can look at the code to check if somebody is spying on you. Yea I\u0026rsquo;m looking at you Microsoft. You can also if you have experience in programming try and help in development of the Linux kernel or software.\n3. Security Now to connect to my last point GNU/Linux is much more secure than windows because updates are comming faster and the code is always changing. It is also because GNU/Linux doesn\u0026rsquo;t have that much usage still but that will probably change soon, maybe even sooner that we think.\n4. Package managers In GNU/Linux it\u0026rsquo;s much easier to find and install software than windows. In windows you need to go to web, then search for software and then find the real link to download the software without the virus. Good luck with that.\nWhile in GNU/Linux you open your terminal and give it the command to install the software. Of course for those that don\u0026rsquo;t know or wan\u0026rsquo;t to use the terminal there is always GUI software stores like gnome store or pamac.\n5. Software There is much more software and it is in most cases more minimal and only have features that you need. In windows you have software that have so many features than you might only use 20% of them, while in linux you can have software only with what you need.\nAlso if you have experience in programming you can fork the program, then add or remove features that you need and maybe release the software.\n6. Ease of use GNU/Linux is much more easir to use than windows. At the very least that is my opinion and to tell those that maybe think that it is because I didn\u0026rsquo;t use windows a lot.I used windows for more than 10 year\u0026rsquo;s si it isn\u0026rsquo;t that i wasn\u0026rsquo;t acustommed to the windows wolrd but linux suits me much more.\n7. Customization You can customize your GNU/Linux desktop to be exactly what you wan\u0026rsquo;t. Like that you can also boost your productivity and ease of use even more. Like what I did whit my setup and ended up with a bspwm setup that I heavily customized. Here you can see a look at my setup.\n   All in all my opinion of GNU/Linux will probably never change because it is just what I need of a desktop OS. But still everyone has their opinion and that is hard to change.\n","date":"2020-07-07","permalink":"https://cronytips.github.io/2020/why-do-i-use-linux/","tags":["linux"],"title":"Why do I use Linux"}]
