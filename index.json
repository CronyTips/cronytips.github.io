[{"content":"In this post I will talk about how to unite gtk and qt themes.\n  example of a qt program using qt5ct\n We all know the pain of trying to unite gtk and qt themes under linux. Most of the time the only thing that you can do is use same gtk and qt theme but there is another way that I have been using and that is using a program called qt5ct. Here you can check it\u0026rsquo;s sourceforge site.\nQt5ct works in a way that it sets the qt theme to either gtk2 or a style with custom colors. You can also change the icons, font and other stuff to make your theming look more consistent.\nNow I\u0026rsquo;m not saying that this program is bug free because I had problems of needing to install a lot of other packages to make it work or the gtk2 option wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work for some reason. And the best way to find the fixes is to look on the Internet for the fix.\nInstallation Qt5ct is from my knowledge available in most distro repository\u0026rsquo;s so you can use your package manager to install the qt5ct package. You also need to install additional gtk engines.\nIt is also preferable that your themes also have a gtk2 version.\nBut before using the software first you need to set an environmental variable QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=\u0026ldquo;qt5ct\u0026rdquo;.\nDepending on you shell you will need to save it in your .profile.\nzsh \u0026gt; `export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=\u0026quot;qt5ct\u0026quot;` inside .zprofile bash \u0026gt; `export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=\u0026quot;qt5ct\u0026quot;` inside .profile   I hope how this will help you get that perfect unified looks on your linux desktop. If you have any questions mention them in the comments section.\n","date":"2020-09-08","permalink":"https://cronytips.github.io/2020/unite-gtk-and-qt/","tags":["linux","open-source"],"title":"Unite Gtk and Qt"},{"content":"In this post I will be talking about a open source epub reader.\n A epub reader is very useful programs especially if you are like me and read light novels or other kind of e-books that mostly come in the .epub format which can be a problem to read without a good epub reader. That is when I came upon a program called Foliate which is able to open epub books without any problems. It is on the slower side ( my laptop is very low end so that might be the case for me only ) but it is still a great piece of software that comes with a lot of useful options and functionality.\n It has a built in library which shows recently opened e-books. You can change reading font, spacing, margins and width. It supports custom themes which allows for those Unixporn users to have a good book look Supports four layout\u0026rsquo;s ( Automatic, Single Column, Scrolled and Continuous ) Can automatically hide cursor Support for realistic shadows ( looks like a real book ) And a lot more options   this is how my foliate looks like\n As you can see from the screenshot above foliate looks very minimal and distraction free when reading which helps you read your books with only text in front of you.\nFrom my experience with foliate you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have problems with opening even some of the drm locked e-books, but I only tried some of them. Image support is great so you wont have problem of having blank space instead of images like in some reader ( I\u0026rsquo;m think about you Zathura ).\nAll in all Foliate is a great epub reader worth using and support. If you want to have a better look ate the Foliate checkout their website\nInstallation Foliate is in both flatpak and snap format, but it is also in the most distros repository\u0026rsquo;s so it should be easy to install with your distros package manager.\nWrite in the comments about your preffered method for reading epub books.\n","date":"2020-08-28","permalink":"https://cronytips.github.io/2020/foliate-open-source-epub-reader/","tags":["open-source","light novels"],"title":"Foliate Open Source Epub Reader"},{"content":"gpg: keyserver receive failed: General error. One of the most annoying errors.\n We all know that time when you try to install some program from aur sometimes you need to a gpg key for it to install and then your keyserver fails or when you do an update and it fails because it cant check the package keys. I know that feeling and it the worst because sometimes it can even destroy you installation like it destroy my xserver because of not updating all needed packages xserver packages.\nFor this problem there are two possible fixes about which I will be talking about now.\n Fix  Manually adding the key using different keyserver.\nTo do that you need to use either of the two next commands with your keyserver of choice and the key you wish to add.\nAur\ngpg --keyserver ${KEYSERVER} --recv-keys ${KEY}\nPacman\nsudo pacman-key --keyserver ${KEYSERVER} pacman-key --lsign-key keyid ${KEY}\nYou use the first command for Aur and second for updates in Pacman.\nFix  Change the default keyserver.\nYou can change the default keyserver by changing the gpg and pacman keyserver default values. To do that you need to do this:\nAdd keyserver ${KEYSERVER} with the keyserver of your choosing at the end of the next two files at this locations.

That is also one of the reasons for a lot of people to not consider linux as their main operating system. But a lot of people also doesn\u0026rsquo;t know that there are free replacements for MS office. Most of the linux users use the replacement called LibreOffice, and I cant say that it is a bad piece of software but for my needs it is bloated, yes bloated because it has so many different options and also so many different office components Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Base, Math, and Charts. And that is a problem for me because I only need a word processor, presentation editor and spreadsheet processor with only the basic editing because thinks like math I will rather do in Latex and make documents with markdown and the use pandoc to compile them to pdf rather that use word. Now then lets see what does OnlyOffice have.\nLook and feel In therms of look and feel it is pretty similar to newer versions of MS Office and that makes it easier for long time MS Office users to get used to the software. It is also very modern looking. It also has a home screen which opens up when you launch the program.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s open-source OnlyOffice is completely open-source. You can see the whole code on their GitHub account. Which means that people that limit them self to only use open-source software wont have anything to say about that.\nCloud integration You can integrate OnlyOffice into a cloud service for example NextCloud without losing any of its features like for example MS Office online which loses a lot of functionality that the desktop version has.\nCompatibility OnlyOffice in my testing was 100% compatible with MS Office files. Sometimes I work with a couple of word and excel documents a day and I never had any problem opening, editing and saving any of the files. Even making new word document never gave me any compatibility issues with MS Office or any other Office. I also never had problems with presentations either actually in overall OnlyOffice works for me better than any other MS Office version (Except 2010).\n All in all OnlyOffice is an amazing office suite with amazing MS Office compatibility that never let me down. I hope that you will give OnlyOffice a try.\nWrite in the comments if you know about any other good ms office alternative.\n","date":"2020-07-31","permalink":"https://cronytips.github.io/2020/only-office-ms-office-replacement/","tags":["linux","open-source"],"title":"OnlyOffice: MS Office Replacement"},{"content":"In this post I will be talking about my favorite web browser Brave.\nWhat browser do you use?

After he came to countryside he decided to die alone.\nAt least that is what was supposed to happen. After a week of coming to countryside and not eating or drinking anything came a young girl that was bought by his father to become his wife.She was like a springtime in his life teaching him of happiness.\nAnd that is a small synopsis of the manga.

Actually it is quite easy because all Light Novels are those that either had Anime or Manga adaption, maybe even both. Now you are maybe asking yourself \u0026ldquo;Why are you only reading them?\u0026rdquo;. Well that is because it means their story captivated me enough to want to know what happened beyond Anime or Manga adaption. And there are a lot of them, I have about 100 Light Novels downloaded ready to be read. And while I\u0026rsquo;m reading them I will probably for those that I start reading that I will from the start review every volume so that I will maybe hook some more of you guys on.\nSo now to do I find and download Light Novels. Well I have 2 main sources, one source has official Translations for those big Novels that have been licensed and second one for web novels that don\u0026rsquo;t have official translations or aren\u0026rsquo;t that known. Now I will name the two sources.\n That Novel Corner  For official translation That Novel Corner is the best source. Every month he takes requests for what Light Novels to first get the official translations. He has a big amount of Light Novels and I really love his work and that is also one of the reasons why I don\u0026rsquo;t have ad blocker on when I download form his site. He accepts donations but since right now and for a couple of yeas in the future I wont have a source of income I wont be able to donate anything, but I still encourage you to if you like his work that you give him donations because the guy deserves the.\nVN Meido  This more like a community than a website where otakus like Me and a lot of other gather. I will link to thread where it list all Light Novels there and I can tell you that there is a huge number of them. Here you will almost always gonna find fan translations of popular but also unknown Light Novels. That is also the reason why I use this community and that is mostly because I love fun translations of unknown Light Novels, just love them. So yeah if you want to only fun translation no strings attached just vn meido for your Light Novels needs because you will be more than satisfied and one more thing is that in the forum Index I linked there are linked all Light Novels on the forum and there are so many of them that the thought of trying to count them never crossed my mind.\n Now after everything is said and done I wish you good reading and have fun immersing in some Light Novels that maybe your haven\u0026rsquo;t even heard of.\nWrite in the comments about how you find and read your light novels.\n","date":"2020-07-13","permalink":"https://cronytips.github.io/2020/light-novels-how-to-find-them/","tags":["light novels"],"title":"Light Novels: How to Find Them"},{"content":"In this post I will be talking about my experience on the topic of gaming on GNU/Linux and its state in this day and age.\n Old Linux veterans must remember the old days when you either wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to play the games that you wanted to play or you had to spend big amount time trying to make the game run at stable performance. But that is not the case anymore, Gaming on Linux is becoming the future day by day and I\u0026rsquo;m not lying. I haven\u0026rsquo;t been a Linux for long time, actually I became a Linux almost 4 years ago. Still I saw a huge improvement in Gaming on Linux.\nFrom the gists that I know before tools like PlayOnLinux, Lutris and Steam\u0026rsquo;s Proton entered the stage you had to spend time manually configuring your games in wine hoping that you will succeed in making the game playable. I remember when I came to linux that Lutris still wasn\u0026rsquo;t a mature as now and there weren\u0026rsquo;t a big amount of steam titles running linux natively and because I have a budget I stirred away from even trying running wine games and only played that small amount of native steam games and a lot of open-source games.\n my Lutris library\n Then about 1 or 2 years later Steam Play was announced and I saw Doom gameplay with Vulkan. I immediately tried to play my games but found it still laking. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to give up so I tried installing some games with Lutris and they worked either with 5-15% lower performance or 5% better performance than on Windows 10. Yes had better performance even though I had a budget laptop.\n my epic games store library\n Then again some time after Lutris managed to get Epic Games Launcher to run on Linux where I had at that time almost over 100 games that I got from giveaways. But there was one problem, my integrated graphics card didn\u0026rsquo;t have Vulkan support or so I thought but a couple months after I found out that my Radeon R2 gpu had experimental support on Linux for Vulkan and I spent a couple of days trying to enable it on my Manjaro installation when I found out that I only had to install amdgpu-experimental and then restart my system and that was it I had Vulkan support up and running.\nConclusion After everything that happen now days I\u0026rsquo;m able to run every game that I was able to run on Windows either with a small performance hit or with better performance. All I can say that even in after a time frame of only 4 years gaming on Linux has become so much better that I never think coming back to Windows because of games. Well I do almost only play singleplayer games so that is also one of the reasons that I never run into problems with gaming, but what can I do about it when I don\u0026rsquo;t have any friends except for Linux. And still I mostly spend time either watching anime, manga or light novels like a true weeb\nWell then I hope that this blog was somewhat informative for all of you and that maybe you will hesitate a little less about coming to Linux because of games.\nYou can also write in the comments what you think of the state of linux gaming.\n","date":"2020-07-12","permalink":"https://cronytips.github.io/2020/gaming-on-linux/","tags":["games","linux"],"title":"Gaming on Linux"},{"content":"In this post I will be writing about an android app called Anyme.\n Anyme is an android app for watching anime from a lot of different sources while also being completely free. I have been using Anyme for almost 2 yeas and never thought of using any other app or program on my phone. Now if you are asking yourself why am I not using something like Crunchyroll or Netflix its because a lot of anime isn\u0026rsquo;t available for my country so I have to stream them and Anyme really helps me watch any anime I want. So why do I love Anyme so much, well here are a couple of reasons.\nCompletely free Anyme is completely free with no ads whatsoever. It also removes ads from the sites it uses which means you will have ad free anime watching experience even on most ad bloated sites without them. It also doest us any permissions which means that it is completely safe.\nMyAnimeList integration Anyme is first app ever that integrated with MyAnimeList ever. That also means you can follow your progress on your pc or any device that has a browser and Internet connection. When you get a new device you wont need to have backups or be scared of loosing all your progress because it is all on the Internet.\nGreat ui Anyme has great ui which you will learn how to use in a couple of minutes and will always want something similar to it. It also has a great search system which is very easy to use but at the same time very advanced.\nHelps you find anime Anyme has a lot of menus which show you what anime is popular right now, what is watched, seasonal, discord recommendations and big variety of genres (categories). It also has recommendations based on what you watched but for this you need to make a Kanon account. There is also a continue menu which opens up menu where you can continue any anime that you might have had missed a season or ova.\nRandom anime Anyme also has a random button that will chose an anime from your plan to watch list. This option helped me because I have almost all the time about 100-150 anime in my plan to watch list.\nStats Anyme also has your stats which show your favorite studio, what genre you watch the most. It also has How many episodes you have watched (by the time of making this I watched 5433 episodes), how many days have you \u0026ldquo;wasted\u0026rdquo; ( 89.9 by the time of this post ) and also a weeb level( my level is 196, which puts me under Anime God ). For this you also need to make a Kanon account.\nAnime info Anyme has a lot of info about every anime which also includes their song which helped me a lot when I\u0026rsquo;m downloading my anime song playlist for traveling. What character where in the show, their voice actors and much more.\nA lot of sources Anyme doesn\u0026rsquo;t host anime it self but uses a lot of different site to stream anime from them with no ads and also being able to download them for offline watching which is pretty neat.\nInstallation Now after I said why I love Anyme so much next is how to install and usage like what account you will need to make. You need to go to Anyme and download apk. After downloading install it. After installation when you open Anyme you will need to either sign up or sing in into an MyAnimeList account. If it is your first time hearing about MyAnimeList click sing up and create an account. After you sing in you will be brought into the app. Just one reminder you will have ti sign in every week because of MyAnimeList. Optionally you can go to stats and make a Kanon for more functionality like the ones that I said already about in this blog.\nYou can also use a different video player for watching. I personally use MX player which is great for android phones. I also recommend that you first check everything about the app like setting and everything else.\n I hope how this was very helpful for most of you. I will be very happy if you where to use or at least try using Anyme for all your anime needs because it is more than you will ever need for an anime watching app especially on android.\nYou can also comment about what program or website you are using for watching anime.\n","date":"2020-07-09","permalink":"https://cronytips.github.io/2020/anyme-android-app-for-watching-anime/","tags":["anime","android"],"title":"Anyme: android app for watching anime"},{"content":"In this post I will write about a open-source manga reader named Tachiyomi.\n After closing of MangaRock I\u0026rsquo;m sure a lot of manga readers had a hard time searching for a different manga reader. That is why I\u0026rsquo;m going to introduce you an open-source alternative that is much better than MangaRock named Tachiyomi. Why do I say that Tachiyomi is better than MangaRock, well let me name a couple of reasons.\n Completely free  Tachiyomi is completely free to use and without any ads. That means you can have a great reading experience without any ads interrupting while reading like in MangaRock.\n Open source  Tachiyomi is also open source which means that you can go and look at the code and see how it work and maybe even contribute if you have programming experience.\n Great ui  Tachiyomi looks great and is easy to get used to. It also has better reader than what you had in MangaRock and you can also set custom color options to make your manga be slightly green or something like, even lowering the brightness for midnight reading.\n A big amount of sources  What I mean by this is that Tachiyomi uses a lot of websites for searching and reading manga. It\u0026rsquo;s sources are made like separate app that community mostly made which means most of most popular manga sites are almost certainly free.\n Unlimited downloads  You can download manga as long you have disk space on your phone. I can say that this is completely true because I always have about 5-6 GB downloaded manga to read for when I\u0026rsquo;m offline.\nNow if I have convinced you let me show you how to use install and use Tachiyomi because it is different than most app that you probably have ever used. I will show you the process of installation and usage with short video clips so that you can if you want skip the text if you don\u0026rsquo;t wanna read.\nInstallation   For installation you will need to go to the Tachiyomi website and click on the download link. Allow your browser to download the apk file. After you have finished downloading open the file. If you phone asks you for permission to install app from unknown sources you need to enable that option. Then click install and wait for it to finish. When installation is finished you have installed Tachiyomi.\nBasic usage Installing source extensions   Sources in Tachiyomi are called extension and you install them like apps because if tachiyomi had all sources in itself you would get updates almost daily and it would be a big download. So back on topic to install source extensions you need to open Tachiyomi app, then click on the browse in the lower menu. Then change to extensions menu with scrolling right to left or clicking on the extensions text. Then you have to chose what extension to install. In this example I use MangaLife. All you need to do is scroll down until you find MangaLife or any other extension and click on the install button. Installation is the same as tachiyomi app which means if it asks you for installation from unknown source enable it, come back and click install button again, then click install again and that is it. It will automatically go back into Tachiyomi app so don\u0026rsquo;t think that something is wrong.\nBest extensions Now I will tell you what are the best extensions that I use.\nFirst extension is Madara that I use for Kissmanga.in (for a lot of unknown manga) and Tonilly (a lot of different kind of webtoons).\nSecond extension is MangaBox which I use for Mangaktalot (One of biggest manga archives).\nThird extension is MangaDex (high quality scans and fast chapter updates) which is my go to source.\nFourth extension is Webtoons for some of the webtoons but I prefer Tonnily for over them.\nFifth extension is MangaLife because of it\u0026rsquo;s high quality scans and occasional official English translations.\nSixth extension is MangaSee because if I can\u0026rsquo;t find manga on any other one MangaSee always has the manga that I want.\nHiding unneeded sources   After installing extensions that I recommended you will have a lot of sources that you don\u0026rsquo;t need. To disable them you need to go into sources and click at the icon in the top right (the one with 3 lines). The you just remove the blue tick from the unneeded sources. I left enabled: Kissmanga.in, MangaDex, MangaLife, Mangakakalot, Mangasee, Toonily and Webtoons.com.\nAdding and removing manga to library   To add a manga you need to go into Browse then you go to source of your choice or search for manga by clicking and the search icon. Either way once you find a manga you want to add to your library, you need to click on the manga. There you will see the description and chapters of manga. To add a manga you need to click the heart icon with text add to favorites. Now when you go to your library screen you will see your manga. To remove manga once again click on it and then click on the heart icon. If you want to remove multiple manga at once you to be in your library screen, then you click on the manga and hold until it show another overlay. Choose other manga that you need to remove and then click the trash bin icon and then you can also choose to delete downloaded chapters.\nenable MangaDex search To be able to search MangaDex you need to do a quick workaround which is: go to any manga from MangaDex, then click on the globe icon next to share icon. After that it will open MangaDex in webview where you need to Sing Up for their account. After that you will be able to use MangaDex search.\nDownloading manga To download a manga you need to choose any manga from your library view. Then you need to go to chapter where all chapters are listed and waiting for you to read them. After that click on the three dots icon in the upper right corner and click Download where you will choose how many chapters will you download.\nRecommended settings to change Now I will list a couple of options that I think you need to change for the best experience for you.\n Theme  To have better enjoyment you can choose between light and dark theme, to do that you need to go here: More \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; General \u0026gt; App theme\nLibrary update frequency  To get new chapters you yourself can set how often the library will update itself. To set your setting you need to got to: More \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; Library \u0026gt; Library update frequency\nReader setting  In tachiyomi you can customize your manga reader a lot and to do that go to: More \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; Reader\nDownload settings  You can also change your download settings a lot give it a thought. For them go to: More \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; Downloads\nAdvanced  It is also a good idea to go to advanced settings at least every month to clean cache and cookies. For that go to: More \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; Advanced\nTracking In tachiyomi you can have third party tools track your progress and I personally use AniList because It is a pretty good thing to have. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to do AniList because Tachiyomi also supports MyAnimeList, Kitsu, Shikimori and Banguni. Every one of them has different setting up so I won\u0026rsquo;t be doing that here.\nBackup\u0026rsquo;s You can also enable backup\u0026rsquo;s in Tachiyomi and I personally have them enabled to every week to create one. You can also choose where to save them so that is isn\u0026rsquo;t easy to lose them.\n After all this I hope that you have some understanding of Tachiyomi and that you will have great experience using it. Please tell me in comments if you found this blog helpful or if you need any help I will gladly help you with all I have knowledge of.\n","date":"2020-07-08","permalink":"https://cronytips.github.io/2020/tachiyomi-open-source-manga-reader-for-android/","tags":["manga","android","open-source"],"title":"Tachiyomi: open-source manga reader for android"},{"content":"In this post I will explain my reason\u0026rsquo;s for using and loving linux. And they also serve as reasons as to why you should use linux.\n 1. It\u0026rsquo;s free GNU/Linux is a free operating system. If I want to install linux on my machine I don\u0026rsquo;t need to spend 100$ on a license just to do a installation or do a clean install. This is also one of the reasons that I distro hopped for about 2 years until I settled down on manjaro for about 1 year.\n2. It\u0026rsquo;s open-source GNU/Linux is open source which means that if you want you can look at the code to check if somebody is spying on you. Yea I\u0026rsquo;m looking at you Microsoft. You can also if you have experience in programming try and help in development of the Linux kernel or software.\n3. Security Now to connect to my last point GNU/Linux is much more secure than windows because updates are coming faster and the code is always changing. It is also because GNU/Linux doesn\u0026rsquo;t have that much usage still but that will probably change soon, maybe even sooner that we think.\n4. Package managers In GNU/Linux it\u0026rsquo;s much easier to find and install software than windows. In windows you need to go to web, then search for software and then find the real link to download without a virus. Good luck with that.\nWhile in GNU/Linux you open your terminal and give it the command to install the software. Of course for those that don\u0026rsquo;t know or want to use the terminal there is always GUI software stores like gnome store or pamac.\n5. Software There is much more software and it is in most cases more minimal and only have features that you need. In windows you have software that have so many features than you might only use 20% of them, while in linux you can have software only with what you need.\nAlso if you have experience in programming you can fork the program, then add or remove features that you need and maybe release the software.\n6. Ease of use GNU/Linux is much more easier to use than windows. At the very least that is my opinion and to tell those that maybe think that it is because I didn\u0026rsquo;t use windows a lot.I used windows for more than 10 year\u0026rsquo;s so it isn\u0026rsquo;t that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t accustomed to the windows world but linux suits me much more.\n7. Customization You can customize your GNU/Linux desktop to be exactly what you want. Like that you can also boost your productivity and ease of use even more. Like what I did whit my setup and ended up with a bspwm setup that I heavily customized. Here you can see a look at my setup.\n All in all my opinion of GNU/Linux will probably never change because it is just what I need of a desktop OS. But still everyone has their opinion and that is hard to change.\nAlso write in the comments your reasons for using or not using linux.\n","date":"2020-07-07","permalink":"https://cronytips.github.io/2020/why-do-i-use-linux/","tags":["linux"],"title":"Why do I use Linux"}]
